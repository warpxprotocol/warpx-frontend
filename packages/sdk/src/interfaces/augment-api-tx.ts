       * 
       * - `origin`: Must be capable of withdrawing the `assets` and executing XCM.
       * - `dest`: Destination context for the assets. Will typically be `[Parent,

       * relay to parachain, or `(parents: 2, (GlobalConsensus(..), ..))` to send from
       * parachain across a bridge to another ecosystem destination.
       * - `assets`: The assets to be withdrawn. This should include the assets used to pay the
       * fee on the `dest` (and possibly reserve) chains.
       * - `assets_transfer_type`: The XCM `TransferType` used to transfer the `assets`.

       * - `fees_transfer_type`: The XCM `TransferType` used to transfer the `fees` assets.
